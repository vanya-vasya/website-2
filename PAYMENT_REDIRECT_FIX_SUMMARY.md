## Changes Implemented

### 1. Payment API Return URL
**File:** `app/api/payment/networx/route.ts`

```typescript
// Changed from:
const returnUrl = process.env.NETWORX_RETURN_URL || 'https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback';
return_url: `${returnUrl}?order_id=${orderId}`

// To:
const returnUrl = process.env.NETWORX_RETURN_URL || 'https://nerbixa.com/dashboard';
return_url: `${returnUrl}?payment=success&order_id=${orderId}`
```

### 2. Dashboard Success Handler
**File:** `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Added imports
import { useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import { toast } from "react-hot-toast";

// Added success notification handler
useEffect(() => {
  const paymentStatus = searchParams.get('payment');
  const orderId = searchParams.get('order_id');
  
  if (paymentStatus === 'success' && orderId) {
    toast.success('Payment successful! Your credits have been added to your account.', {
      duration: 5000,
      icon: 'üéâ',
    });
    
    // Clean up URL parameters
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    url.searchParams.delete('payment');
    url.searchParams.delete('order_id');
    url.searchParams.delete('token');
    url.searchParams.delete('status');
    url.searchParams.delete('uid');
    window.history.replaceState({}, '', url.pathname);
  }
}, [searchParams]);
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
npm test __tests__/integration/payment-dashboard-redirect.integration.test.ts
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ 19 test cases
- ‚úÖ All passing
- ‚úÖ Regression coverage
- ‚úÖ Edge case coverage

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Visit with success parameters
http://localhost:3000/dashboard?payment=success&order_id=test_123

Expected:
‚úÖ Success toast appears
‚úÖ URL cleaned to /dashboard
```

```bash
# Failed payment
http://localhost:3000/dashboard?payment=failed&order_id=test_123
‚ùå No toast

# Canceled payment
http://localhost:3000/dashboard?payment=canceled&order_id=test_123
‚ùå No toast

# Missing order_id

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
1. ‚ùå User completes payment
2. ‚ùå Redirected to broken 404 page
3. ‚ùå Confusion and frustration
4. ‚ùå Has to manually navigate to dashboard
5. ‚ùå No confirmation payment succeeded

1. ‚úÖ User completes payment

## Webhook Processing (Unchanged)

- Balance updates happen via webhook (separate process)
- Webhook processes payment in background
- Balance updated regardless of where user navigates

```
Payment Complete
      ‚Üì
  Two Paths:
      ‚Üì
  ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
  ‚Üì        ‚Üì
User     Webhook
Redirect  Updates
  ‚Üì      Balance
Dashboard   ‚Üì
  ‚Üì       (DB)
Success
Toast
```
