# Payment Redirect to Dashboard - Implementation

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Priority:** P1 (High)

---

## Overview

Updated the post-payment flow to redirect users directly to the Dashboard after successful payment verification, eliminating the intermediate success page countdown.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. New Payment Callback Page ‚úÖ

**File:** `/app/(dashboard)/payment/callback/page.tsx`

**Purpose:**
- Verifies payment status immediately after redirect from payment gateway
- Polls balance verification API
- Shows real-time verification status
- Redirects to dashboard automatically upon verification
- Provides user feedback with toast notifications

**Flow:**
```
User Completes Payment
        ‚Üì
Networx Redirects to /payment/callback?order_id=xxx&status=successful
        ‚Üì
Callback Page Verifies:
  ‚Ä¢ Payment status = successful
  ‚Ä¢ Balance verification (polls every 2s, max 30s)
        ‚Üì
Balance Verified ‚úÖ
        ‚Üì
Toast Notification: "Payment successful! X credits available"
        ‚Üì
Redirect to /dashboard (1 second delay)
        ‚Üì
User sees Dashboard with updated credits
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time payment verification
- ‚úÖ Visual status indicators (verifying, success, pending, error)
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications with credit balance
- ‚úÖ Automatic redirect to dashboard
- ‚úÖ Fallback handling for timeout scenarios
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid callbacks

### 2. Updated Payment Return URL ‚úÖ

**File:** `/app/api/payment/networx/route.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const returnUrl = process.env.NETWORX_RETURN_URL || 'https://nerbixa.com/payment/success';

// AFTER
const returnUrl = process.env.NETWORX_RETURN_URL || 'https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback';
```

**Impact:**
- Users are now redirected to `/payment/callback` instead of `/payment/success`
- Callback page provides instant verification and redirect
- No more 5-second countdown wait

5 SECOND COUNTDOWN ‚è±Ô∏è

## Technical Details

### Callback Page States

| State | Description | User Sees | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| `verifying` | Initial state, checking payment | Loading spinner + "Verifying Payment" | Polls balance API |
| `success` | Payment verified, balance updated | Green checkmark + "Payment Verified!" | Redirect after 1s |
| `pending` | Verification timeout (30s) | Yellow clock + "Payment Processing" | Redirect after 2s |
| `error` | Invalid callback or missing params | Red error icon + "Verification Error" | Redirect after 2s |

### Balance Verification Logic

```typescript
// Poll every 2 seconds for max 30 seconds
const maxAttempts = 15; // 15 attempts * 2 seconds = 30 seconds
let attempts = 0;

const pollBalance = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/payment/verify-balance?transactionId=${orderId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  
  if (data.success && data.balanceUpdated) {
    // Balance verified!
    toast.success(`Payment successful! ${data.currentBalance} credits available`);
    setTimeout(() => router.push('/dashboard'), 1000);
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

### Status Handling

The callback page checks the `status` query parameter:

```typescript
const status = searchParams.get('status');

// Only proceed if status is successful
if (status && status !== 'successful' && status !== 'success') {
  toast.error('Payment was not completed successfully');
  router.push('/dashboard');
  return;
}
```

**Supported Status Values:**
- `successful` ‚úÖ - Process verification
- `success` ‚úÖ - Process verification
- `failed` ‚ùå - Show error, redirect to dashboard
- `canceled` ‚ùå - Show error, redirect to dashboard
- `pending` ‚è≥ - Show pending, redirect to dashboard

---

## Environment Variables

### Required Configuration

```bash
# Networx Return URL - Updated to callback page
NETWORX_RETURN_URL=https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback

# Production
NETWORX_RETURN_URL=https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback

# Staging
NETWORX_RETURN_URL=https://staging.nerbixa.com/payment/callback

# Local Development
NETWORX_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/callback
```

### Other Networx Variables (unchanged)

```bash
NETWORX_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id
NETWORX_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NETWORX_WEBHOOK_URL=https://nerbixa.com/api/webhooks/networx
NETWORX_TEST_MODE=false
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Old Success Page

**Status:** Still functional ‚úÖ

**File:** `/app/(dashboard)/payment/success/page.tsx`

Users who have the old URL bookmarked or linked will still see the success page with the 5-second countdown. This page remains functional for:
- Manual navigation
- Direct links
- Bookmarks
- Legacy integrations

### Migration Path

**Phase 1 (Current):** ‚úÖ Complete
- New callback page created
- Payment API updated to use callback URL
- Old success page remains functional

**Phase 2 (Optional):**
- Monitor usage of old success page
- Consider redirecting `/payment/success` to `/payment/callback`
- Update any hardcoded links in emails/docs

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Successful Payment:**
```bash
# Navigate to callback page with test params
http://localhost:3000/payment/callback?order_id=test_123&status=successful&token=test_token

# Expected:
# - Shows "Verifying Payment"
# - Polls balance verification
# - Shows "Payment Verified!" (if transaction exists)
# - Redirects to /dashboard after 1 second
```

2. **Test Failed Payment:**
```bash
http://localhost:3000/payment/callback?order_id=test_123&status=failed

# Expected:
# - Shows error toast
# - Redirects to /dashboard after 2 seconds
```

3. **Test Missing Parameters:**
```bash
http://localhost:3000/payment/callback

# Expected:
# - Shows error state
# - Shows error toast
# - Redirects to /dashboard after 2 seconds
```

### Integration Testing

```bash
# Full payment flow test
1. Go to /dashboard
2. Click "Buy Tokens" in Pro Modal
3. Complete payment on Networx hosted page
4. Verify redirect to /payment/callback
5. Verify verification process
6. Verify redirect to /dashboard
7. Verify credits updated
8. Verify success toast shown
```

### Verification Checklist

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

1. **Redirect Time to Dashboard**
   - Target: < 5 seconds from payment completion
   - Monitor: Average time from callback to dashboard

2. **Verification Success Rate**
   - Target: > 95% verified within 30 seconds
   - Monitor: Percentage of successful verifications

3. **Callback Page Errors**
   - Target: < 1% error rate
   - Monitor: Invalid callbacks, missing params

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor callback page access
grep "Payment callback received" production.log

# Monitor verification success
grep "Payment verified! Redirecting to dashboard" production.log

# Monitor verification timeouts
grep "Balance verification timeout" production.log

# Monitor callback errors
grep "Invalid payment callback" production.log
```

## Deployment

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Code:**
```bash
git checkout fix/post-transaction-credits-flow
git pull
vercel --prod
```

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Update NETWORX_RETURN_URL in Vercel dashboard or via CLI
vercel env add NETWORX_RETURN_URL production
# Enter: https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback
```

3. **Verify Deployment:**
```bash
# Check callback page is accessible
curl https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback

# Test with query parameters
curl https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback?order_id=test&status=successful
```

4. **Update Networx Dashboard (if needed):**
   - Log into Networx merchant dashboard
   - Verify return URL matches: `https://nerbixa.com/payment/callback`
   - (Usually set via API, not dashboard)

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Quick Rollback:**
```bash
# Revert environment variable
vercel env rm NETWORX_RETURN_URL production
vercel env add NETWORX_RETURN_URL production
# Enter: https://nerbixa.com/payment/success
```

2. **Code Rollback:**
```bash
vercel rollback
```

3. **Verify Rollback:**
```bash
# Payments should redirect to old success page
# Old flow will work as before
```
