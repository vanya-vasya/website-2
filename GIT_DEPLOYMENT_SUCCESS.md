## Commit Message

```
feat: implement payment flow cleanup with auto-redirect and database separation

- Auto-redirect to Networx payment page immediately after token creation (500ms delay)
- Removed manual 'Proceed to Payment' button step for better UX
- Added inline error handling with visual feedback in payment widget
- Deleted legacy payment webhook handler to prevent duplicate processing
- Enhanced Networx webhook with comprehensive data separation policy
- Added safeguards: payment webhook never creates users (Clerk-only)
- Improved idempotency using webhookEventId unique index
- Added user existence validation (404 if user not found)
- Clean separation: Transaction table for all transaction data
- Clean separation: User table for profile and balance only
- Enhanced logging and documentation throughout webhook handler
- Added PAYMENT_FLOW_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md with full implementation details
- Added PAYMENT_FLOW_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for troubleshooting guide

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed app/api/webhooks/payment/route.ts (duplicate handler)
- Payment webhook now requires user to exist (created via Clerk first)

Closes: Payment flow improvements and database cleanup
```
