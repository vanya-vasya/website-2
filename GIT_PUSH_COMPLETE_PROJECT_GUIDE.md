### Step 3: Create and Switch to New Branch

```bash
# Create new branch for the complete project push
git checkout -b feature/complete-project-with-diagnostics-2025

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

git push website-2 feature/complete-project-with-diagnostics-2025

# Set upstream tracking for future pushes
git push --set-upstream website-2 feature/complete-project-with-diagnostics-2025
```
