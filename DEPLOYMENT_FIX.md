# Deployment Fix - Clerk Import Path

## Issue

The initial deployment failed with the following error:

```
Type error: Module '"@clerk/nextjs"' has no exported member 'auth'.

./app/api/payment/verify-balance/route.ts:2:10
```

## Root Cause

The balance verification API route was using an incorrect import path for Clerk's `auth` function:

**Incorrect:**
```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
```

**Correct:**
```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
```

## Fix Applied

Updated the import path in the following files:

1. **API Route:**
   - `app/api/payment/verify-balance/route.ts`
   - Changed from `@clerk/nextjs` to `@clerk/nextjs/server`

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - `__tests__/integration/payment-redirect.integration.test.ts`
   - Updated mock to use correct import path

3. **Unit Tests:**
   - `__tests__/unit/verify-balance.unit.test.ts`
   - Updated mock to use correct import path

## Verification

All other API routes in the project use the correct import path:
- `app/api/code/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/conversation/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/generations/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/image/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/music/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/speech/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/style-transfer/route.ts` ✓
- `app/api/video/route.ts` ✓
