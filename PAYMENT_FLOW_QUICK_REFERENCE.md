# Payment Flow - Quick Reference Guide

## User Flow

### 1. Token Creation & Payment
```
User clicks "Create Payment Token"
         ↓
Token created (500ms)
         ↓
Auto-redirect to Networx payment page
         ↓
User completes payment
         ↓
Redirect to /payment/success
         ↓
Balance verification (polling)
         ↓
5-second countdown
         ↓
Auto-redirect to /dashboard
```

**Error Cases:**
- Token creation fails → Inline error shown, no redirect
- Payment fails → Success page shows error state
- Balance verification times out → User can manually navigate to dashboard

## Data Flow

### User Creation (Clerk)
```
Clerk Sign Up → Clerk Webhook → Create User + Initial 20 Credits
```

### Payment Processing (Networx)
```
Payment Complete → Networx Webhook → Create Transaction + Update Balance
```

---

## Database Rules

### ✅ DO
- Create users **only** via Clerk webhook
- Store **all** transactions in Transaction table
- Update **only** balance in User table (for payments)
- Use `webhookEventId` for idempotency
- Check user exists before processing payment

### ❌ DON'T
- Never create users in payment webhook
- Never store transaction data in User table
- Never update user profile in payment webhook
- Never process duplicate webhooks (check idempotency)

## Troubleshooting

### Payment not processing?
1. Check webhook logs in console
2. Verify `NETWORX_SECRET_KEY` is correct
3. Ensure user exists (created via Clerk)
4. Check `Transaction.webhookEventId` for duplicates

### Balance not updating?
1. Check webhook signature verification
2. Verify `tracking_id` matches `clerkId`
3. Check for transaction rollback errors
4. Verify token extraction from description

### Redirect not working?
1. Check `payment_url` in API response
2. Verify no JavaScript errors in console
3. Check network requests for token creation
4. Ensure email is provided
